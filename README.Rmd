# MedialandscrapeR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MedialandscrapeR is to provide a function to easily scrape the starting pages of swiss online newsmedia. The package currently supports the following media-outlets: Watson.ch, 20Minuten.ch, srf.ch, tagesanzeiger.ch.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MedialandscrapeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jineichen/MedialandscrapeR")
```

## Examples

The basic function of the MedialandscrapeR-package is called "mediascraper".
You must only specify one of the supported outlets you want to scrape and you are ready to go. After execution the function will initiate a selenium-client to scrape the outlets that you specified. The function will return a r-dataframe that includes title, lead and body of a given news-article (the latter is not supported in the case of srf.ch) as well as the link to the article, the outlet it stems from and the exact timepoint at which it was scraped. You can scrape only one or multiple outlets simultaneously.

```{r example, eval = F}
library(MedialandscrapeR)
mediascraper(outlets = c("Watson"))
mediascraper(outlets = c("Watson", "20 Minuten"))

```

You can also adjust the browser and the port that is used by Rselenium.

```{r eval = F}
mediascraper(outlets = c("Watson", "20 Minuten"), browser = "firefox", port = 4501L)
```

You can add *sqldb = TRUE* if you rather want to store the results of the scraping-process in an sql database. It you decide to do so, you can also specify a name for the database (the default is "scrapingresults") by passing a name to the dbname-parameter.

```{r, eval = F}
mediascraper(outlets = c("Watson", "20 Minuten"), browser = "firefox", port = 4501L, sqldb = TRUE,
                        dbname = "scrapingresults")
```

The function also has the ability to provide you with some summary-plots that give you more detail about the nature of the articles you just scraped. Setting *plots* to *TRUE* gives outputs the following graphs:
Absolute number of articles per outlet,
Mean-length of article-titles per outlet,
Mean-length of article-leads per outlet,
Mean-length of article-bodies per outlet (only supported for Watson.ch and 20Minuten.ch).

If you want to count the appearances of a specific term in the titles of the articles you can pass a regex-pattern to the parameter *searchterm*. The function will then produce and return a plot that shows you the absolute number of appearances of the provided pattern per outlet.

```{r, eval = F}
mediascraper(outlets = c("Watson", "20 Minuten"), browser = "firefox", port = 4501L, sqldb = TRUE,
                        dbname = "scrapingresults", plots = TRUE, searchterm = "\\Jans\\b")
```
